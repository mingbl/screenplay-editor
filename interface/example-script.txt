IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE
by Frank Capra

FADE IN:

EXT. THEATRE – NIGHT

GEORGE
Merry Christmas, movie house!
*laughing face*

CUT TO:

INT. POTTER'S OFFICE – NIGHT

Potter is seated working at his desk, his goon by his side. George pounds on the window.

GEORGE
Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!
*winking face*

George runs off as Potter looks up from his work.

POTTER
Happy New Year to you – in jail! 
Go on home – they're waiting for you!
*mad face*
